## Still open (owner: the client, Section 22.2)

| # | Question | Default in the code |
|---|---|---|
| DB | PostgreSQL (22.1) vs MongoDB in use | MongoDB, replica set required in production |
| 17A | Mobile-app section missing from the PDF | Apps send `X-Client: app` and get Bearer tokens |
| DEC-19 | MSG91 DLT sender and templates | `SMS_PROVIDER=dev` test inbox; MSG91 not wired |
| DEC-22 | May an advisor store the full Aadhaar? | Stored encrypted, masked, consent first |
| DEC-10 | Consent wording | Declaration texts from P-17 |
| DEC-12 | Retention (audit 8 years, OTP 30 days) | Not enforced yet (SYS-10) |
| Q4–Q8, Q15, Q17, Q18, Q20 | Payment, GST, premium, need analysis, KPIs, providers | Superseded by the v3.2 processes of those modules; review when each is built |
| Q25 | P-05: Business has a CFG-124 weight (10%) but no required item. When does it count? | Counts once the advisor has saved the Business section, so a new advisor starts at 0% (`profile.service.ts`) |
| Q26 | FLD-34: should the GSTIN check character be verified? The BPD gives the shape only, and its own example (29ABCDE1234F1Z5) fails the official check | Shape only. Recommended: verify it (`gstinChecksumValid()` exists) and correct the example in VAL-39 |
| Q27 | FLD-22 / VAL-27: which virus-scanning service checks uploaded files? | No scan yet; VAL-27 is never shown until a scanner is chosen (needed before go-live) |
| Q28 | P-07 needs ACTIVE insurers, which the catalogue (P-20, Module 8) maintains | The insurer record has every P-20 field and state now. Until Module 8, insurers are created with the development tools (`POST /v1/dev/insurers`, refused in production) |
| DEC-09 | Same insurer and agent code in two accounts | Both mappings are flagged silently (`flaggedAt`); SkyUp sees them at `GET /v1/admin/agent-code-flags`. Neither advisor is told. To confirm |
| Q32 | P-18 step 6: Aadhaar/PAN read from a document replace the customer's value "after the user confirms a change", but the BPD has no message text for that confirmation | Never overwritten automatically: Confirm saves the document and reports `identity.differs`; the screen offers the P-15 identity change, which has its own messages |
| Q33 | P-18 step 5 automatic reading. **Decision (27-10-2026): Google Document AI, plain OCR processor in asia-south1 (Mumbai)**, fields found by our own parsers (no generative-AI extractor: P-18 forbids PAN/Aadhaar in AI requests). Mumbai single-region access may need Google's request form. CFG-37 (OCR confidence) is not applied to identity fields yet | `DOCUMENT_READER=google` + `DOCUMENT_AI_*`; reading runs after the save (GR-26), 30 s per call, CFG-38 overall; any failure → manual entry (DOC-10). `none` keeps manual entry only |
| Q34 | AC-P18-6 "infected file is refused" needs the scanning service of Q27 | Type, size and damaged-file checks are in place; the infection check waits for Q27 |
| Q35 | P-18 Missing box (DOC-08): only the customer, or also each household member? | The customer only (Aadhaar and PAN) |
| Q36 | P-54 "registration unique in the account": also across SOLD (INACTIVE) vehicles? Taken literally, a car one client sold could not be recorded for the client who bought it | Unique among ACTIVE vehicles only (database rule). Reactivating a sold vehicle whose registration is ACTIVE elsewhere gets VEH-03 |
| Q38 | CU-17 asks for MASKED Aadhaar copies only, but Confirm requires the full 12-digit number (P-18). With a masked copy the number cannot be read and must be typed from elsewhere. Linked to DEC-22 (may the full Aadhaar be stored?) | Masked copies give no number (by design); the user types it, or leaves Aadhaar unconfirmed |
| Q39 | P-21 backend rule assigns CAT-16 to bands that overlap or leave gaps, but CAT-16's text is "Minimum must not be more than maximum." | CAT-16 is returned on the offending band for reversed, overlapping and gapped bands; the screen marks that band. Suggest a dedicated message for overlaps and gaps |
| Q40 | P-21 has no message for a duplicate insurance type name | GEN-04: "This action is not allowed because this insurance type is already in the catalogue." |
| Q37 | P-54 "uploaded photos are discarded after CFG-135" vs files never being deleted (object lock, Q29) | Unattached uploads are never linked to anything and stay unused in storage; a cleanup policy needs deciding with Q29 |
| Q41 | P-22 step 2: which insurers may an advisor build an own product on? Any ACTIVE catalogue insurer, or only those in their My insurers (P-07, appointed with an agent code)? | Any ACTIVE catalogue insurer (the check is in `publishCheck`; the console lists ACTIVE insurers from `GET /insurers`). If P-07 applies, change the backend check, not only the list |
| Q42 | Brochure uploads (`BROCHURE`) are allowed for `products.own` only, so SkyUp cannot attach a brochure to a verified product and must give the insurer page link and the date checked. Intended? P-23 (brochure reading) will need SkyUp uploads | Verified products: link and date. Advisors: brochure optional |
| Q43 | P-22 step 4: the owner chooses UPCOMING, ACTIVE or WITHDRAWN. Should ACTIVE be refused while the launch date is still ahead (it makes the product quotable early)? | Stored as chosen (UPCOMING with a passed launch date already reads as ACTIVE). The console offers the status that matches the launch date |
| Q44 | P-26 scores five facts (room rent, co-pay, pre-existing waiting period, claim settlement ratio) but templates have no fixed feature keys | Facts are found by feature NAME ("room rent", "co-pay", "pre-existing … waiting", "claim settlement"). A type whose template names them differently scores them 0 "Not stated by insurer". Suggest fixed feature keys for these four |
| Q45 | P-26 premium before the quotation engine (P-27): MANUAL_ENTRY products, or rate rows that need a quotation answer ("Asked in the quotation"), have no premium to rank on | Budget fit 0 with the reason shown; the product still ranks on the other four facts |
| Q46 | P-26 AI summary (CFG-101): no AI service is connected yet | Always FIT-05 ("The written summary is not available right now. The scores are complete."); ranking never depends on it |
| Q47 | Authorised categories were limited to the starting types (CFG-115), so types added later with + Type (P-21) could never be authorised or ranked | Choices are CFG-115 plus every ACTIVE catalogue type, checked on save (VAL-22) |
| Q48 | P-27 "Who: ADV", yet P-27 also says override and discount are refused for an assistant (GEN-03), implying assistants work on quotations | Assistants can prepare and generate quotations; price override and discount are the advisor's only (GEN-03) |
| Q49 | Quotation PDF design (companion document CD-04) is not in the BPD | A plain one-page PDF with every P-27 snapshot item; amounts print as "Rs." because standard PDF fonts have no ₹ sign. Replace with the CD-04 design when available |
| Q50 | P-28 Email share needs the email service (Communications, P-39 to P-43, Module 14) | The share runs every check, starts validity and records the email as QUEUED (P-28's own failure rule); it is sent once Module 14 exists |
| Q51 | P-55 step 4 pre-fills nominees "from the customer's default nominee", which P-35 (Module 12) introduces | Nominees start empty until Module 12 adds the default nominee; the P-35 rules (POL-11 to POL-17) already apply |
| Q52 | P-55 creates the policy record AWAITING_ISSUANCE, but policies are Module 12 (P-33) | A minimal policy record (status and frozen members, declarations, nominees, product, premium, payment) is created on Submit; Module 12 extends it |
| Q53 | CFG-174 lists declaration questions for Health, Term Life and Motor only | Types named like "term"/"life" or "motor" use their lists; every other type uses the Health questions |
| Q54 | P-33 creates a renewal cycle, but renewals are Module 13 (P-37, P-38) | A minimal renewal cycle (status, due date, grace until, reason) is created and kept in step by P-33, P-34 and P-36; Module 13 adds reminders and renewal actions on it |
| Q55 | P-55 required a 100% nominee total even with no nominees, making nominees mandatory on every proposal | The total applies once at least one nominee is entered; products that require nominees are enforced at P-33 (POL-07) |
| Q56 | P-37 queues customer reminders by email and WhatsApp, but sending is Communications (Module 14, P-39 to P-43) | Reminders are written to an outbox as QUEUED or SKIPPED (with reason) under every P-37 rule; Module 14 sends from the outbox. The advisor's own reminders (DSH-14, DSH-25) work now in the bell |
| Q57 | REN-T1 wording is marked [TO CONFIRM] in the BPD | Used as written: "Dear {first name}, your {product} policy ending {last 4 digits} is due for renewal on {date}. Please contact {advisor} on {mobile} to renew it on time." |
| Q58 | The daily job time CFG-63 is "08:00 IST" | Stored as the hour (8); the minute sweep runs the job once per IST day at or after that hour |
| Q59 | WhatsApp (Meta), email and payment-gateway providers and their accounts are not chosen yet | One provider interface with a development provider (test inbox, failure switch); webhooks are signed with WEBHOOK_SECRET; production refuses 'dev'. Each real provider implements send, submitTemplate and webhook parsing |
| Q60 | CFG-162 (₹1.00 per WhatsApp message) is marked [TO CONFIRM against Meta rates] | Used as ₹1.00 (stored in paise); changeable by an Admin |
| Q61 | Webhook event format depends on the providers | A neutral signed format: STATUS (DELIVERED, READ, FAILED), STOP, BOUNCE, TEMPLATE (APPROVED, REJECTED); payments: orderId, paymentId, status. Provider adapters translate to it |
| Q62 | Email has no sending window in the BPD (CFG-64 is WhatsApp) | Emails send at any time; WhatsApp only inside CFG-64 |
| Q63 | P-46 shows the advisor's logo on the public referral page, but uploaded files are private (owner-only) | The page shows the advisor's name and business name; the logo needs a public, cacheable logo URL (to add with the P-05 profile logo) |
| Q64 | CFG-141 lists "Family; Friend; Colleague; Neighbour; Customer of the …" (cut off) | Family, Friend, Colleague, Neighbour, Customer of the advisor, Other |
| Q65 | P-46 step 3a's exact rule for "already known" is partly cut in the BPD | A lead or customer with the same mobile in the account created in the last CFG-77 days → LINKED_TO_EXISTING |
| Q66 | FLD-26 referral code characters | 8 characters from uppercase letters and digits without look-alikes (no 0, O, 1, I) |
| Q67 | CFG-82 plan prices are "set by SkyUp [TO CONFIRM DEC-06]" | Placeholders, changeable by an Admin (P-49): Normal ₹499/month, ₹4,990/year; Premium ₹999/month, ₹9,990/year, before GST |
| Q68 | Upgrade credit is [TO CONFIRM DEC-06] | Upgrading Normal → Premium starts at once; the unused days of the current paid period are credited pro rata against the new price |
| Q69 | CFG-80 subscription-end reminders (15, 7, 1 days) have no message ID in the BPD | Not sent yet; SUB-11 (trial ending) and SUB-05 (in grace) are sent. Add a message ID to send them |
| Q70 | SUB-16 "number ready": who records the dedicated WhatsApp number once Meta assigns it | The set-up starts (SUB-15) on Premium purchase; recording the number (and SUB-16) is to be added with the real WhatsApp provider |
| Q71 | GST invoice document design and email attachment | Invoice numbers (INV/FY/NNNNN), GST split and totals are stored and shown in Billing history; the PDF invoice design is to come |
| Q72 | Account export files are ZIPs, which the file store did not accept | Accepted only for the server-built ACCOUNT_EXPORT purpose (never uploadable); uploads are unchanged |
| Q73 | Call recordings: who may listen (advisor only, assistants, SkyUp under a support grant)? | The advisor only. Assistants see the calls (time, duration) but cannot play or download recordings, also not through /files |
| Q74 | Call recordings: how long are they kept? | Kept until the client decides. Storage has no delete by design (document vault), so automatic deletion needs a deliberate exception for recordings once a period is agreed |
| Q75 | Call logs from the phone include the advisor's personal calls | Only calls to the account's lead, customer or family-member numbers are stored; all others are counted as ignored and never saved (DPDP data minimisation) |
| Q76 | iPhone: no automatic recording sync (iOS gives apps no access to call audio) | iPhone users log calls from the web app (duration estimated, marked approx.) and attach a recording by hand from Notes or Files |
| Q77 | Customer notice that calls are recorded | Not enforced by the system; the Google dialer announces recording, others may not. A BPD consent rule is suggested |
| Q78 | Which synced calls count as contact attempts on a lead | Answered outgoing or incoming → Spoke to customer; unanswered outgoing or rejected → Not reachable; a missed incoming call is not counted |
| Q79 | Campaigns: past leads ("Import last 30 days") vs BPD 22.3 (no bulk import) | New leads only. Google cannot resend past leads anyway; Meta/LinkedIn backfill can be added once confirmed |
| Q80 | Campaigns: which plans | All plans while the account is active; a read-only account keeps each submission as FAILED with the reason, and Retry imports it after renewal |
| Q81 | Campaigns: what assistants see | The sync log, imported leads and their form answers; connecting, keys, mapping and Retry are the advisor's. Ad spend (Meta/Google sync) will be advisor-only |
| Q82 | Website form keys sit in the website's page (GTM tag or form code), so they identify the site but do not prove a lead is genuine | Keys are stored as a keyed hash, rotatable (old key valid 7 days); per-IP limit (CFG-194) and a spam-trap field protect the endpoint; our embeddable form needs no key in the page |
| Q83 | Imported lead sources | New sources Meta Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads and Website form; Paid ads stays for old leads (hiding it for new manual leads is part of change #17) |
| Q84 | Duplicate rule for imported leads | The same mobile as an open lead or a customer of the account is linked (submission LINKED, answers visible on the lead), never a second lead |
| Q85 | Old CRM issues fixed while porting | Google key looked up by keyed hash instead of decrypting every company's config; column_id read before the deprecated column_name; test leads kept but not counted; every submission stored before import, with Retry; logs never print names or numbers |
| Q86 | Change #17: CFG-133 stored display text, and rules matched that text, so renaming a source broke the referrer, client and campaign rules | Stable codes (`lib/leadSources.ts`); CFG-133 is a list of codes; labels kept on each lead for older clients. Run `db:migrate:lead-sources` once |
| Q87 | Change #17: "Manual entry" overlaps "Walk-in or personal contact" (analysis §8.2) | Added as its own source as the design shows; confirm whether it means "no source" |
| Q88 | Change #17: should existing "Paid ads" leads be re-tagged as Meta Ads or Google Ads? | Left as they are (code PAID_ADS, readable, not offered). The advisor may correct one lead at a time (audited) |
| Q89 | Imported website leads: the design calls the source "Website"; the build uses "Website form" to tell imports from manually entered website enquiries | Kept as WEBSITE_FORM (import-only). Confirm if dashboards should merge it with Website |
| Q90 | Change analysis §5.3 / §9.1: feature switches and their message texts (FLG-01, FLG-02, CMP-08) are not in the BPD | Switches registered in `modules/flags/flags.ts`, ADM-only with OTP and reason; message texts to be added to Section 21 |
| Q91 | Change #11: one switch or two for "Mark accepted needs PAID" and "recording a payment no longer auto-accepts"? (§2.8 still open) | Two account switches (`quotation_accept_requires_payment`, `payment_skips_auto_accept`), so either can ship alone; both off by default |
